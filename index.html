    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
    <p>
        I translate text, documents, websites, and apps between languages.
        I specialize in medical translation.
        I have three years of bachelor's studies in biomedical sciences,
        one year of work experience as a pharmacy technician and
        currently study nursing at the University of Alicante.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in Brazil, grew up in Canada, and currently live in Spain.
        I am fluent in Portuguese, French, and English.
        I have a certified B2 in Spanish writing and communication,
        and a certified C1 in written and oral understanding.
    </p>
    <p>My language pairs are the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>French to and from English</li>
        <li>French to and from Portuguese</li>
        <li>English to and from Portuguese</li>
        <li>Spanish to French, English, or Portuguese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I am highly experient in the usage of LaTeX, Typst, and Poppler for typesetting and analysing documents,
        and offer translations in near-identical formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        My rates are 0.12-0.16 EUR per word for translation with an extra 0.04 EUR per word for customized formatting.
        Non-formated translations will still respect the core aspects of the original layout,
        such as number of columns, text alignment, images, font-type, and font size (serif or non-serif).
